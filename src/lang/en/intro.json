      "A self-transfer flight is built from separate tickets, often across different airlines. Unlike a traditional layover, your flights aren’t linked — so you’ll check in separately, collect your luggage at stopovers, and may pass through customs or immigration depending on the country.",
      "Why choose self-transfer? It unlocks more route options, gives you more control over your journey, and often means better prices. And with Mytrip’s Self-Transfer Guarantee, you’re covered if things don’t go as planned.",
      "We’ll guide you through exactly what to expect, every step of the way."
