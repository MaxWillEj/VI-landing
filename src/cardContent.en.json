  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do I have to collect and recheck my bags?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you booked a self-transfer, your baggage won’t be moved automatically between flights. You’ll need to collect it and check it in again at your layover airport."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I go through security again?",
      "answer": "Usually, yes. You’ll likely exit and re-enter security, especially when changing terminals or airlines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I miss my flight?",
      "answer": "Because each flight is a separate booking, missed connections are not automatically rebooked. But if your booking includes Mytrip's Self-Transfer Guarantee, you may be rebooked or refunded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a visa for my layover country?",
      "answer": "Maybe. Even if you stay in the airport, some countries require a transit visa. Always check the rules for your layover country before flying."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I check in for all flights at once?",
      "answer": "No, each airline requires its own check-in. You’ll need to check in separately for every leg of your trip — online check-in is highly recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I travel with checked baggage?",
      "answer": "You can, but it’s riskier. If your layover is short, there might not be enough time to collect and recheck your bags. Consider cabin bags only."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Self-Transfer Guarantee?",
